## Summary of the Project
We are planning to use Computer Vision to construct a plugin that will take in objects from the Minecraft screen, and output accurate captions of what those objects are. The applications of this include autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, planes, boats, etc.), which must know what objects it sees and recognize which of those it must avoid while moving.

## AI/ML Algorithms
Deep learning for images is the main algorithm that will be used.

## Evaluation Plan
### Quantitative Evaluation


### Qualitative Evaluation
